# Flowscan NFT Dashboard Resources

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to provide information and resources for the NFT dashboard grants program by Flowscan. 

## Project Overview

We are planning to have **two** additional pages on Flowscan. 

### 1. Global NFT Dashboard

This page will be located at https://flowscan.org/nft-stats. In this page, we would like to display the overall state of NFT sales and volume on the Flow blockchain, for example:
- List of all NFT projects on Flow with basic stats such as 24h sales and transfers
- List of all marketplaces on Flow with basic stats such as 24h volume and trades
- Statistics of the activity, (e.g. sales, volume), presented in charts and counters

### 2. Specific NFT Dashboard 

This page will be located as a new tab(s) on NFT contract page (e.g. https://flowscan.org/contract/A.0b2a3299cc857e29.TopShot). In this page, we would like to display more specific, in-depth metrics on a particular NFT project, such as: 
- Sales activity / volume
- Numbers of listings
- Number of owners
- Floor and average prices
- Top Holders
- Traits distribution

Displaying these information would help in giving insights for Flow users to know more about the activity of NFT projects on the Flow blockchain. Project owners would also benefit from the insights and data of their project. 

We believe that this project could help enrich the Flow ecosystem as a tool that both the consumers and project owners find useful. If you're interested in working together with us to create an important tool for the Flow ecosystem, feel free to [apply](apply.md)!

## Process

Selected applicants will develop together with the Flowscan team in building this project, with the tasks assigned according to the applicant's team (see more in [grants](grants.md)). 

All applicants shall join our private Discord channels dedicated for this project as a main method of communication between teams. Depending on the applicants availability we might have a weekly call as a progress report and sync-up between teams.
