## Overview 

## Teams

We're planning to recruit 4 teams to do this project. 

Note that a _team_ here can be one individual or a group of individuals, and one individual can work in multiple teams. The planned teams are: 

### 1. Indexers 

Two major tasks: 
- Build a service (written in `go`) to index and standarise marketplace listings and sales across the chain. 
- Build a service (written in `go`) to index NFT metadata 

### 2. Metrics Aggregator

Build a service (written in `go`) to aggregate data from our data sources (PostgreSQL) and store them as time-series analytics data

### 3. GraphQL

Expand our GraphQL service (written in `go`) to add additional queries for NFT analytics.

### 4. Frontend 

*Design* and *develop* the front-end web interface.
