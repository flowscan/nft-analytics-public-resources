## Notes

### Indexers 

*Indexers* projects requires no dependencies.

*Marketplace Indexers* are planned to be finished within *1 week* on the third week of February. It is a simple service without much variations (there's not that many marketplaces compared to NFT projects for example). 

After finishing the marketplace indexer, the team can start working on the *NFT Metadata Indexer*.

NFT metadata / traits indexers are a very complex project which could take *5 weeks*.

### Metrics Aggregator

*Marketplace Metrics* dependencies:
- Finished *Marketplace Indexer*
- Finished mockup design to know what metrics are needed

*NFT Holders Metrics* dependencies:
- Finished mockup design to know what metrics are needed

### GraphQL

*Marketplace API* dependencies:
- Finished *Marketplace Indexer*
- Finished mockup design to know what queries are needed

*NFT Metadata API* dependencies:
- Usable *NFT Metadata Indexer*
- Finished mockup design to know what queries are needed

### Front-end 

Although the mock-up design are placed at two weeks in February, changes in design could happen mid-development and to be communicated with related teams (e.g. GraphQL or Metrics).

### Flowscan

Every launch weeks (e.g. 3rd week of March) the Flowscan team may ask teams other for assistance in integration and deployment.
