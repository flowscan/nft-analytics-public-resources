### Front-end 

Although the mock-up design are placed at two weeks in February, changes in design could happen mid-development and to be communicated with related teams (e.g. GraphQL or Metrics).

The **Global Dashboard** might be updated to add more fields (alongside with the launch of **Specific Dashboard**), because at this time, more data is available from the **NFT Metadata API**.

### Flowscan

Every launch weeks (e.g. 3rd week of March) the Flowscan team may ask teams other for assistance in integration and deployment.
