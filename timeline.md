### Disclaimer

The timeline written here are just an estimation based on the current scope of the project. The timeline is flexible, i.e. some tasks can be done faster or slower than expected.

## Notes

### Indexers 

**Indexers** projects requires no dependencies.

**Marketplace Indexers** are planned to be finished within **1 week** on the third week of February. It is a simple service without much variations (there's not that many marketplaces compared to NFT projects for example). 

After finishing the marketplace indexer, the team can start working on the **NFT Metadata Indexer**.

NFT metadata / traits indexers are a very complex project which could take **5 weeks**.

### Metrics Aggregator

**Marketplace Metrics** dependencies:
- Finished **Marketplace Indexer**
- Finished mockup design to know what metrics are needed

**NFT Holders Metrics** dependencies:
- Finished mockup design to know what metrics are needed

### GraphQL

**Marketplace API** dependencies:
- Finished **Marketplace Indexer**
- Finished mockup design to know what queries are needed

**NFT Metadata API** dependencies:
- Usable **NFT Metadata Indexer**
- Finished mockup design to know what queries are needed

### Front-end 

Although the mock-up design are placed at two weeks in February, changes in design could happen mid-development and to be communicated with related teams (e.g. GraphQL or Metrics).

The **Global Dashboard** might be updated to add more fields at the first half of May (alongside with the launch of **Specific Dashboard**), because at this time, more data is available from the **NFT Metadata API**.

### Flowscan

Every launch weeks (e.g. 3rd week of March) the Flowscan team may ask teams other for assistance in integration and deployment.
